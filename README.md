# MemorablePlaces
This gives you the functionality to select some memorable places froma  google map.
you can long press on a particular location to add it in your list of memorable places.
This is not yet comlete since it cannot retain the data after the app has been closed.
will be updated in the near future when I complete a section on permanent storages.
